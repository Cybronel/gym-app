# What is this repo about?

This is a full stack web application made by myself only, as a personal project for my portfolio.

## What is the web application for?

It is an app used to log your workouts in the gym, I think this type of app is useful to everyone that takes "going to the gym" seriously, because progress is made only when you realise you've progressed from your past self.

So, i decided building my own app, because i always had messy excel files with my workout logs.

I want this app to be available to everyone for free.
